  description: `I've been working as a in-house/freelancing full stack developer over 8 years.

  As long as I've been working with several companies and individual employers, I've got more experience and achieved success with them by learning from each other.
  
  The most challenge I've faced during the time is to analyze the requirement and setup the plan to achieve the goal from lack of decription on client's side.
  The approach that I've applied is to draw a diagram and make MVP based upon client's requirement and replenish the missing things for giving back to the client well described picture.`,
